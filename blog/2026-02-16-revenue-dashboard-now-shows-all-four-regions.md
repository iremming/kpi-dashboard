We've significantly enhanced the revenue dashboard by adding comprehensive regional data visualization. The line chart now displays revenue trends across all four major regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.

This expansion provides a more complete picture of our global revenue performance, allowing stakeholders to compare regional trends side-by-side. Each region is represented by a distinct color-coded line, making it easy to identify patterns and spot opportunities across different markets.

The underlying API endpoint has been updated to return data for all regions, maintaining backward compatibility while providing richer data. This change enables better strategic decision-making by giving visibility into how each region contributes to overall revenue growth.

With this enhancement, product managers and executives can now quickly assess regional performance variations and identify markets that may need additional focus or investment.
