This update enhances the revenue line chart by incorporating revenue data for the previously missing regions: Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. The chart now provides a comprehensive view of revenue distribution across all key geographical areas. This was achieved by modifying the API to fetch data for all four regions and updating the frontend component to render this expanded dataset accurately. The changes ensure a more complete and insightful representation of global revenue performance.
