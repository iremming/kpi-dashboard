This update enhances the revenue line chart by incorporating revenue data for all four regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. Previously, the chart only displayed data for North America. The API powering this chart has been updated to fetch and aggregate revenue data across all regions for the latest date. This provides a more comprehensive view of the company's global revenue performance directly on the dashboard.Additionally, minor updates were made to `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, and `wiki/Components.md` to reflect this enhancement in the documentation and changelog.
