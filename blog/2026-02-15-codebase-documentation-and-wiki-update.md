## Codebase Review and Wiki Population

This ticket involved a comprehensive review of the existing codebase to ensure proper documentation. The following wiki pages have been created/updated to reflect the project's current state:

*   **architecture.md:** Details the tech stack (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL), project structure, and data flow.
*   **conventions/code-style.md:** Outlines observed code style practices, including the use of modern JavaScript and React Hooks.
*   **conventions/naming.md:** Documents naming conventions for files (kebab-case) and components (PascalCase).
*   **components/README.md:** Provides an overview of key components such as `ActiveUsersCard` and `ChurnRateCard`, along with their purposes.
*   **business-rules/README.md:** Describes the domain logic, specifically the calculation for active user growth.

Additionally, the existing `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` have been reviewed for accuracy.

This documentation effort aims to improve codebase understanding and maintainability for the entire team.
