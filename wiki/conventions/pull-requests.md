- Under 72 characters

## Description Structure

### Summary
1-2 sentence overview of what this PR does and why.

### Changes
- Bullet list of meaningful changes grouped by area
- Don't list every trivial file change — group logically

### Testing

### Notes (if applicable)
Breaking changes, migration steps, or reviewer callouts.

## Rules
- Use present tense ("Add", "Fix", "Update")
