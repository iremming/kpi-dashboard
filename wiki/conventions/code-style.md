# Code Style

This project adheres to modern JavaScript (ES6+) and React best practices, leveraging Hooks for functional components. The codebase utilizes a consistent indentation, typically 2 spaces, which aligns with standard configurations for Vite and React projects.

Key observations:

- **Modern JavaScript:** Use of `let` and `const`, arrow functions, template literals, destructured assignments, and spread syntax.
- **React Hooks:** Components primarily utilize functional components with Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side effects.
- **Indentation:** Consistent 2-space indentation is observed throughout the codebase.
- **Formatting:** Generally follows common Prettier-like formatting conventions, leading to readable and maintainable code.
